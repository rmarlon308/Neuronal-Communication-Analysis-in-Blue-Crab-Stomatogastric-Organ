# Information Theory Practice
This project analyzes data from two neurons (LP and VD) in the blue crab's stomatogastric organ. Using information theory techniques (entropy, mutual information, temporal, and SAX coding), it aims to unveil communication patterns between these neurons in control, GABA injection, and recovery conditions.

## Overview
This practice involves the implementation of temporal spike encoding and SAX encoding of signals. The code is organized into seven files.

## Files

### Temporal Spike Encoding
These files contain the temporal spike encoding for different stages:

- **analisis_control.ipynb**: Contains the encoding for the control stage.
- **analisis_gaba.ipynb**: Contains the encoding for the GABA stage.
- **analisis_recuperacion.ipynb**: Contains the encoding for the recovery stage.

### SAX Encoding of Signals
These files contain the SAX encoding for different stages:

- **analisis_control_sax.ipynb**: Contains the SAX encoding for the control stage.
- **analisis_gaba_sax.ipynb**: Contains the SAX encoding for the GABA stage.
- **analisis_recuperacion_sax.ipynb**: Contains the SAX encoding for the recovery stage.

### Functions File
- **funcs.py**: Includes two functions used for threshold calculation and generating encoding graphs.
